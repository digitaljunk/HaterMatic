This code uses SparkFun's 6-value coin accecptor (COM-11636) and thermal
printer (COM-10438) to allow people to pay to have a lovely complement
directed at them.

Resources:
SoftwareSerial library
avr/pgmspace.h    

Development environment specifics:
Developed in Arduino 1.8.1
Developed on a SparkFun Arduino Pro Mini 5V/16MHz (DEV-11113)

This code is beerware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the
local, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!

// First things first: let's include the files we need to make all this happen.

#include <SoftwareSerial.h> // Support for the software serial port we'll use
                            //  to talk to the coin acceptor and printer.
#include <avr/pgmspace.h>   // Support for reading data (in this case our
                            //  strings) from flash memory. This eases
                            //  the burden on the much smaller SRAM, at the
                            //  cost of increased memory access time.
#include "loveStrings.h"    // Header file created for this project, which
                            // contains all the complement strings.

// Some definitions that will help us elsewhere in the code.
//  The definitions for number of complements of each time can be found in the
//  "loveStrings.h" file.

// These are pin redefinitions.
#define COIN_INPUT 7  // Serial (or pulse) input from the coin acceptor.
#define PRINTER_OUTPUT 8 // Serial output to printer
#define GET_LOVE A0 // Pushbutton input from insult request button.
#define INHIBIT 9     // Reject any further coins inserted

// Instantiate a software serial port on pins COIN_INPUT and PRINTER_OUTPUT.
//  Note that the printer communicates at 19200bps and the coin acceptor at
//  9600bps; this isn't a big deal because this is a half-duplex system, so
//  we can change between them at will, and use the INHIBIT signal to prevent
//  coins being accepted during print cycles, so we know no data will come
//  from the coin acceptor when the baud rate is wrong.
SoftwareSerial swser(COIN_INPUT, PRINTER_OUTPUT); // RX, TX

// We'll use two more defines to increase the readability of our code. The
//  preprocessor will simply replace any instance of "coinInput" or
//  "printerOutput" with "swser". Under the hood, it generates the same code,
//  but it lets us keep tabs on what we're doing more easily.
#define coinInput swser
#define printerOutput swser

// Set up a debug mode. If we define DEBUG to be 0, that will make the
//  necessary code changes later on to route the output to the printer. If we
//  define DEBUG to be 1, it will set up the code
